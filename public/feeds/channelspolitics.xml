<p>While ruling in an <a title="Ex parte refers to those proceedings where one of the parties has not received notice and, therefore, is neither present nor represented. If a person received notice of a hearing and chose not to attend, then the hearing would not be called ex parte."> ex parte</a> motion brought by Honourable Abubakar Lado and Olanipekun Jimoh, seeking to stop the Speaker from appointing principal officers, Justice Gabriel Kolawole held that the issue was a domestic affair of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Justice Kolawole said that &#8220;the court could only intervene when there is substantial infraction of the 1999 Constitution&#8221;, stressing that &#8216;for now there has been no breach of the Constitution&#8217;.</p>
<p>He added that it was not the duty of the court to choose principal officers for the National Assembly, because it had its own machinery.</p>
<p>The court also maintained that it would not allow itself to be used as a platform by aggrieved members, to get what they should canvass on the floor of the House.</p>
<p>Justice Kolawole insisted that  the court was not a supervising institution for the National Assembly on account of Separation of Power and that there was no evidence before the court that the constitution had been breached.</p>
<p>He, therefore, refused the application in its entity  and thereafter directed that the defendants in the substantive suit, which includes the Speaker of the House of Representatives, his Deputy, the Clerk of the House and the Clerk of the National Assembly, be put on notice and served with the originating summon.</p>
<p>The case has been adjourned to August 12 before Justice Adeniyi Ademola.</p>
<p>In a related development, an ex parte <a href="http://www.channelstv.com/2015/07/28/court-rejects-application-to-stop-constitution-of-senate-committees/">order seeking to stop the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, from constituting the Senate Standing Committe, was rejected</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Judge, Justice Kolawole, said there was nothing urgent in the application.</p>

<p>Senator Marafa claimed that the leadership of the upper chamber of the National Assembly would favour their friends in the appointment of the chairmen of the Senate standing committees.</p>
<p>He also joined the Deputy Senate President, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives in the suit.</p>

<p>Addressing reporters after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday, alongside Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State, Oshiomhole said the meeting they had with the warring Senators on Sunday evening was useful.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel the position now is ‘look how do you ensure that having elected this two (Senate President and his Deputy), that the remaining position that are within the discretion of the APC caucus in the Senate are distributed in a way as to give the other group that were shut out of the process a sense of belonging?</p>
<p>&#8220;We are convinced that a winner-takes-all in this case won’t work and building peace is making concession and power works better when it acknowledges that even the person who is powerless has a right to exist,&#8221; the Edo State Governor said.</p>
<p>Oshiomhole told reporters that he had met with President Buhari to brief him on how their meeting with the Senators went.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother (Bagudu) and I spent some time with the senators last night (Sunday) and we had what I think was a useful conversation. We have come today to report to the President what transpired at the meeting and make few suggestions to him and I think for me there is light, as they say, at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing is clear, we are all APC family, we are all committed to change. We recognise that there are few issues; people may not be comfortable, but we have what it takes to resolve the issues so that in the National Assembly we will have an APC Senate caucus that is united, that is ready to support the change agenda as the President is committed to and work along with PDP.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody is suggesting that we shouldn’t work with PDP. PDP exists in the House, just as APC had existed in the House under PDP government. So, at some point there has to be a way to engage bipartisan. So, that is basically why we are here,&#8221; Governor Oshiomhole stated.</p>
<p>The National Assembly has been embroiled in crisis following the emergence of Senator Bukola Saraki as Senate President and Senator Ike Ekweremadu of the Peoples Democratic Party as Deputy Senate President.</p>
<p>The party had nominated Governor Oshiomhole and his Kebbi State counterpart, to mediate between the warring Senators.</p>

<p>Leading the PDP youths on Monday from the 21 Local Government Areas to the Government House in Lokoja, the Kogi State&#8217;s capital, north-central Nigeria, the Leader of the youths, Engineer Steve Onoji, said they supported Governor Wada because of his human development stride.</p>
<p>Onoji thanked the Governor for making it possible for some of the youths at the grass root to enjoy the dividend of democracy.</p>
<p>He added that the youth came under one umbrella after the last congress, reiterating that Wada was the best and marketable option for the party.</p>
<p>The Majority Leader of the Kogi State House of Assembly, Honourable Friday Makama, also congratulated the Governor for a successful congress.</p>
<p>He said the last congress held in the state was the best ever, stressing that the youths had no alternative to his candidacy.</p>
<p>Governor Wada said he was awaiting the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) to lift up barn before he would declare his intention on whether to contest or not, for a second term.</p>
<p>He thanked the youth for their endorsement and urged them to be law abiding by staying out of trouble.</p>
<p>The Governor then assured the people of the state that he would ensure that a free, fair and credible election would be conducted on November 21, 2015.</p>

<p>Doing its own assessment of President Muhammadu Buhari&#8217;s visit to Washington in the United States, the PDP said that nothing beneficial to the country would follow the meeting.</p>
<p>The ruling APC said that the PDP cannot provide a virile opposition, describing its criticism as convoluted and hollow statements.</p>
<p>The APC claimed that there had been no government in Nigeria&#8217;s recent history that has been as focused and systematic as the one headed by President Buhari.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.channelstv.com/2015/07/27/pdp-cannot-provide-virile-opposition-with-convoluted-hollow-statements-apc/">statement by the APC&#8217;s Publicity Secretary, Mr Lai Mohammed</a>, the party said, &#8221;President Buhari is working hard every day in the priority areas of tackling security and corruption, rebooting the economy to provide jobs for our teeming youths and generally to restore good governance. We are sorry for those who are too blind with hatred to see this.</p>
<p>&#8220;The PDP is terrified by the expose of how the Federal Government it led has looted the treasury and created an environment for impunity to thrive, as well as the fate that will befall those who were part of the show of shame and disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we assure Nigerians that this government will not interfere with the work of the security and anti-corruption agencies, and also that under the Buhari administration, only the guilty needs to be afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>The PDP, in its assessment, had opined that &#8220;the only achievements and change brought by the APC government are the curbing of the fundamental human rights of citizens; engaging in selective application of war against corruption, interfering in the activities of the National Assembly and eroding the independence of INEC&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The order of the day has become the crass victimization and harassment of officials of the immediate past administration.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ruling party has, however, advised the Peoples Democratic Party to be cautious in its role as the opposition.</p>
<p>&#8221;To be in opposition does not mean you have to constitute yourself to a nuisance by rushing to the press with all sorts of hot air statements. It is the quality, rather than the frequency, of your interventions that makes you relevant as an opposition in a democracy,&#8221; the APC said.</p>
