<p>The LMC had fined Kano Pillars and Baba-Ganaru for breaching the rules during the movement of the coach from Nasarawa United to Kano Pillars.</p>
<p>Ganaru&#8217;s sanction includes the payment of a fine of 200,000 Naira, forfeiture of one month salary to Nasarawa United and a further forfeiture of five million Naira, being 50 per cent of his sign-on fees, as agreed in his contract with Nasarawa United for the 2014/2015 season.</p>
<p>Kano Pillars, on the other hand, were fined 500,000 Naira and were also directed to pay two million Naira as compensation to the Nasarawa side within two weeks.</p>
<p>In reaction, Ganaru said: &#8220;To the best of my knowledge, everything went well in the transaction&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, the spokesman of Kano Pillars, Idris Malikawa, claimed the club had followed due process in the acquisition of the coach.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did everything right. We have written to the LMC to explain our part of the transaction. I cannot disclose the content of the letter. Only the LMC can tell you (the press) our response. Nasarawa United have complained and we responded before the expiration of the 48 hours given by the LMC,&#8221; Malikawa said.</p>

<p>The former Welterweight champion, Berto, has 30 wins and three losses before the bout with his fellow American.</p>
<p>Britain&#8217;s Amir Khan had hoped for a September fight with Mayweather, after beating Chris Algieri in June.</p>
<p>However, Mayweather has instead opted for an opponent who has lost three of his last six fights, with Berto suffering reverses to Victor Ortiz and Robert Guerro, both of whom have also been beaten by Mayweather.</p>
<p>If he wins, Mayweather&#8217;s record will equal that of legendary 1950s American Heavyweight Marciano, who retired from the sport without suffering a professional defeat.</p>

<p>The revised stadium is expected to open just three months before the Olympic games begin in 2020, missing the 2019 rugby tournament entirely.</p>
<p>The rugby officials hastily organised a meeting with the Japanese organisers on the sidelines of the International Olympic Commission session in Malaysia, to discuss how this would affect the tournament.</p>
<p>Reuters is quoting the World Rugby Chief Executive, Brett Gosper, as saying: &#8220;I think everyone was surprised by the announcement from the Prime Minister of Japan, the Olympic movement included, and we were all taken a little bit aback by that.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had plans to use that incredible stadium, obviously for our finals and key games in World Cup 2019, so we met with the 2019 people here from Japan two days ago&#8221;.</p>

<p>At the end of the regulation time, Arsenal Manager, Arsene Wenger, had a reason to celebrate against Jose Mourinho&#8217;s Chelsea, having failed to win in any of his previous 13 attempts.</p>
<p><span style="color: #1c1c1c;">In February 2014 the Chelsea boss called Wenger a &#8220;specialist in failure&#8221;, and then in October the Gunners boss shoved his rival during a heated touchline quarrel.</span></p>
<p>Alex Oxlade-chamberlain scored the winner with a powerful drive into the top corner with his weaker left foot.</p>
<p>The Gunners named goalkeeper Petr Cech in their starting line-up following his summer move across London while Theo Walcott, who has just signed a lucrative new deal, led the arsenal attack.</p>
<p>It is the first time that Arsenal is beating a Mourinho-led Chelsea side since 2011.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Will Not Be A Friendly&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Before the match, Arsene Wenger said that the Community Shield against Chelsea &#8220;will not be a friendly&#8221;.</p>
<p>According to arsenal.com, Wenger admited that a victory in the match, which would be his first against Chelsea Manager, Jose Mourinho, is capable of shaping his team&#8217;s confidence for the 2015/16 season.</p>
<p>Having enjoyed a perfect pre-season performance, Wenger hopes his side would maintain their momentum against the champions, but warned against reading too much into the result.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to accept that every game is decided and judged as definite,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But you know that in real life it is not like that. The tribunal is out there and will draw conclusions from Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;But no matter, positive or negative (result), we have to continue our way and focus on ourselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a game that is important but it is still preparation. We want to win it and overall it can just give us that little bit more confidence before we go into the season.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, it will not be a friendly as it is like that and it is good like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Gunners go into the match on a run of four successive victories at Wembley, and having scored 14 goals during pre-season.</p>
<p>The morale of the team would have been boosted by the duo of Santi Cazorla and Theo Walcott, who have both <a href="http://www.channelstv.com/2015/07/31/cazorla-and-walcott-sign-new-arsenal-deals/">agreed contract extensions</a> with the English giants.</p>
<p>The victory will be a boosted for the team, as they prepare for the commencement of a new Premiership season.</p>

<p>Midfielder Ngozi Okobi put Nigeria ahead in the 12th minute, but the Falcons then conceded anÂ equaliser, with only four minutes left.</p>
<p>The Nigerian girls, who could only pull a 1-1 draw in the first leg in Abuja, were then caught off-guard in a goal-mouth scramble with only eight minutes left in extra time.</p>
<p>The Super Falcons in their last outing in the Women&#8217;s World Cup in Canada failed to make it through the group stage, after getting a draw against Sweden and losing to U.S. and Australia.</p>

The medals are six gold and three silver.</strong></em></p>
<p>The star boy of day-5 isÂ SundayÂ Olowoniyi. The 20-year-old beat Panama&#8217;s Loaiza Tamir and South Korea&#8217;s Jeong Seong Jun by three games to top the men&#8217;s singles division six and win another table tennis gold for Nigeria.</p>
<p>Victoria White set the ball rolling on day-4 of the competition, winning gold in table-tennis. It was an almost flawless performance by the young Nigerian who defeated her opponents from India, Macau and the United Arab Emirates without dropping a game in her division.</p>
<p>Rasaq Muraina and Jeffrey Olu-Imaferami continued the gold rush for Nigeria with excellent displays in badminton, adding to the cycling gold won by Emuwa Chidubem in the 500 meters time trial.</p>
<p>Sikiru Sadiq threw a distance of 6.72 meters to win silver in the 4kg division mo8 shot put event, while the basketball team rounded off proceedings with an exciting 28-23 win over Belgium.</p>
<p>Once again, Moshood Popoola emerged the star of a good team performance scoring 10 points and recording 10 rebounds. The next game is a top of the table clash against Korea.</p>
<p>Team Nigeria started their campaign at the Special Olympics World Games with Tejumoluwa Ogunlela winning silver in division 15 of the 100 metres womenâ€™s freestyle.</p>
<p>Adebiyi Olatunji and Adedamola Roberts consolidated to win gold and silver in division 17 of the 100 meters men&#8217;s freestyle event.</p>
<p>On day-2, Nigeria crushed South Africa 6-0 in division one of the unified soccer event. Two first half goals from Daniel Osadolo ensured a great start at the Balboa Sports Center.</p>
<p>In the second half, Coach Stephen Adeyomo&#8217;s team turned up the heat on their opponents with further goals from Abubakar Adebayo and Eziema Chukwudi, ensuring a comfortable win.</p>
<p>On the same day, Nigeria defeated Canada 33-21 points in Basketball, to advance to the next round. The West African team dominated the first quarter 17-9, but the Canadians fought back in the third to reduce the deficit. The 4th quarter saw another close battle, before Nigeria eventually pulled away late in the game.</p>
<p>With athletes such as Sadiq Sikiru, Chidubem Emuwa, Fatai Fatimoh and Mbum Esther also receiving medals for successful outings in shot put, cycling and standing long jump.</p>
<p>Team Nigeria will be hoping the medal chase continues before the competition ends on August 2, 2015.</p>
<p>The 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games opened on July 25, 2015 in Â Los Angeles, California. The 2015 Â Games feature competitions in aquatics, gymnastics, track and field, basketball, football (soccer)Â and many other summer sports involving 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from around the world.</p>
