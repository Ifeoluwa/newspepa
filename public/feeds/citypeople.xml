				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Chief Nojeem Abioye, the Baale of Temidire Alagbado in Lagos, and 11 others have been remanded in prison custody by an Igbosere Magistrates Court, pending legal advice from the office of the Director of Public Prosecution, DPP, over the murder of an alleged gay hotelier. The other defendants who were arraigned alongside the traditional ruler and his son are Adeola Ogungbade, 37; Ogundare Ogunsanya, 63; Olanlerewaju Ololade, 62, and Bello Lasisi, 60. Others are Ajani Kasali, 54; Oyedele Musiliu, 64; Jonathan Sanyaolu, 68; Taoreed Bakare, 61; Olaidi Albert, 66 and Wahab Abioye, 38.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The defendants were arraigned by the police before the court over the death of the hotelier. The defendants, were arraigned on a 5-count charge bordering on conspiracy, rioting, malicious damage, arson and murder, preferred against them by the police. The prosecutor, J. I. Enang, told the court that the late hotelier was murdered during a riot on July 20 at Alagbado area of Lagos State. Enang further said that the traditional ruler allegedly spearheaded the protest that caused the death of the hotelier and one Ganiyu Adebayo, said to be son of a landlord at Alagbado. Magistrate Ajayi, subsequently, ordered that the defendants be remanded in prison custody pending the DPP’s advice.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">There are reports that the Ooni of Ife, Oba Okunade Sijuade, has been moved to the Ile’gbo, a sacred temple where he was coronated. The Ile’gbo Shrine which is located within the palace was the starting point for the late Oba and he must return to the same place to handover. According to a chief, the Ooni arrived at the palace and was received by members of the Isoro Cult, and his passage rites continued at the Ile’gbo.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In his words, “The Kaabiesi’s journey to the throne started from that place called Ile’gbo. That is where he was installed as Ooni. That is the place where anyone that will succeed him will also be installed. The body is being preserved through traditional means. Details may not be too good for publication. The rites will be done while the body is kept there. But don’t expect formal announcement of his death in the next two weeks. The formal announcement will take time depending on how fast the Isoro members are able to conclude the necessary rites. The body is there as I speak to you, but even his family members can no longer see him”.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Afeez Baruwa, a part-time lecturer, has been arrested by men of the Lagos State Police Command for allegedly raping an 18-year-old girl, identified as Caroline (not real names) in the Yaba area.Caroline was reportedly raped inside a study room. The teenager was seeking admission into the University of Lagos, Akoka. It was gathered that Baruwa was arrested by the Surulere Police Division on Monday, August 3.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Going by police reports, the lecturer told the police in his statement that the sexual intercourse was by mutual consent, insisting that he did not rape the victim. The lecturer and Caroline’s father belonged to the same landlords’ association in Abesan, Ipaja area of Lagos. Caroline&#8217;s father had allowed her daughter to follow the lecturer on July 23, to UNILAG for an admission process. It was learnt that Baruwa allegedly took the girl inside one of the study halls, bolted the door, and raped her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">After reporting the incident to her parents, Caroline was taken to a non-governmental organisation, Mirabel Centre, where she was tested and the medical result reportedly confirmed that the teenager was violated. It was at this point that Caroline was taken to the Lagos State Office of the Public Defender, and the matter was reported at the police station. Afeez Baruwa, who is said to be an employee of another university, not UNILAG, was subsequently arrested.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari, Mallam Garba Shehu has said contrary to an editorial published in the Nigerian Pilot of August 2, 2015 and an earlier report in which the total cost of President Muhammadu Buhari&#8217;s recent trip to the U.S. was estimated at N2.2 billion, the total cost of the trip to the Nigerian taxpayer was at the most minimal, in line with the policy of this administration to cut waste and extravagance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Shehu made this disclosure in a statement saying,&#8221; It is very sad that in this age of free-flowing information and in this era of CHANGE, a media organisation would make itself available as a vehicle to peddle a lie of such low and ignominious quality. In point of fact, the total amount expended on the trip by the Office of the President amounted to nothing near ten per cent of the speculated figure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Owing to the free accommodation provided by the host government, all the personal staff who accompanied the President on the trip received reduced allowances. His son, Yusuf, received neither allowances nor estacode. The five Governors on the trip each paid his own way. Permanent Secretaries who traveled on the delegation did so in accordance with extant rules and none of them exceeded their estacode entitlements.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Most publications in the USA like Newsweek and others closed down concentrating on their online platform; do you see such a thing happening in Nigeria in the nearest time</strong>?</p>
<p>No, I don’t think the hard copy would die. For our kind of culture, for our kind of politics, no. people still want to hold a newspaper and feel it with their hands. There is joy in somebody putting his advert in a newspaper and holding a newspaper like this (Held some newspapers brought by his vendor) We want to feel the newspaper in our hands ands read either the story or the advert. Two of them will live side by side. They will compliment each other. I don’t think E-journalism will kill conventional journalism; they will live side by side.  I don’t pray it kills the conventional newspaper business because newspaper is our world. It is our baby and we don’t pray it dies. It is newspaper that made us; we made our name with newspaper business. We cannot just allow it go like that.</p>
<p>After the death of your friend, Dimgba Igwe, there was a promise by government to tar Dele Orisabiyi street and re-name the street after Dimgba Igwe but on arriving here today, the road has gotten worse than before.</p>
<p><strong>What happened to that government promise? </strong></p>
<p>Well, I did everything I can do to campaign for that road to be re-named Dimgba Igwe Street, for it to be tarred so that wherever he is, he will be happy. So that people even living on the street will even be remembering him and say ‘thank God we had a man like this’. Something to immortalize him, I told (Governor) Fashola and he gave his own explanation on why this place cannot be singled out. He gave all kinds of explanations and what do I do now? He was the governor and I don’t blame him. If his hands were tight there is nothing I can do than to pray that at the right time, the street will be tarred. I don’t know what else I can do again, I have written about it, I have lobbied for it but it is not over, maybe (Governor) Ambode will do it, maybe when I get to know him, I will still carry the battle to him and to see wether Dimgba Igwe street dream can become a reality. I pray it will be and it is not just this street alone, all the streets in Okota. I am praying that development will touch every part of Okota because to say that I only want my street, that will be an act of selfishness.</p>
<p><strong>(Cuts in) But that will not be too much to honor the memory of a great soul like Uncle Dimgba Igwe?</strong></p>
<p>Well, I am not government and I cannot force government to break their rules. I can only do what is within my own limitation. We would continue to pressurize them to do it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>AWOYINFA Tells City People About The Book</strong></p>
<p>Mike Awoyinfa is a veteran journalist and Editor who keeps a regular column in  The SUN every Saturday. It will be one year in September since his best friend and colleague, Pastor Dimgba Igwe died. To mark the anniversary of his death, a new book will be launched on September 6, 2015. Awoyinfa has already sent out letters inviting media gurus to the launch of the book which is a compilation of the views of 50 World Editors. He wrote: “In the course of attending newspaper conferences all over the world, we went the extra mile interviewing newspaper editors and media icons from some of the best newspapers around the world, all sharing in this book their thoughts, experiences and time-tested wisdom on journalism our beloved profession. This book is the fruit of all our efforts. We believe this book will go a long way in teaching the younger generation lessons in journalism history and also improve their skills.” Recently, GBENGA ASABE interviewed Awoyinfa on this new book which he co-edited with his friend and colleague, late Dimgba Igwe. It is titled 50 World Editors: Conversations With Journalism Masters On TRENDS &amp; Best Practices and what he has been up to one year after his best friend and colleague Dimigba Igwe died. Below are excerpts of the interview.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT OUR NEW BOOK; 50 WORLD EDITORS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your new book. What is it about?</strong></p>
<p>Fifty editors, all around the world, telling their stories; telling their journalism journey and how they made it and talking about journalism generally, about editing and stories that defined them and how they became editors and what they did in their time as editors. The book is like a Bible of journalism. For the first time I can boast and say ‘this is the greatest journalism book ever’. We have never seen it anywhere in the world; a book, a compendium of editors of the greatest newspapers in the world; Newyork Times, Washington Times, Chicago Tribune, Times of London, The Guardian, CNN, Reuters, The Mirror, The Sun, BBC, Associated Press, editors past and present. These are people who are repository of journalism wisdom, sharing their thoughts and sharing their ideas. People think when we travel, we just go out, travel for fun and pleasure but they don’t know there is no pleasure in it, when we travel, we travel for business and when we go for this conferences and people are talking, you will see us, with our tape recorder just like you do. Singling out people worthy of interviews, those were the things we did for ten years or so. We combined it into a book and the good thing is; Dimgba saw the book before he died. The book is finished, it is already in and he saw it before he died. He was part of the planning, the design of the book and everything. He saw the book, he held it and he was very, very pleased and happy with the book. So, that is the book we are to launch on September 8th 2015 at the National Institute of International Affairs, Victoria Island, Lagos.</p>
<p><strong>That will be just two days after Dimgba Igwe’s death?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, and we are hoping everybody will be there. We are hoping to bring President Muhammadu Buhari there as the Special Guest of honor. We are dreaming that Mike Adenuga will be our Chief Launcher.  We will do everything possible to make it a befitting book launch that my friend, wherever he is, would be proud and fulfilled to have been part of such a great project. It is not just a celebration of a book; it is a celebration of an icon, a great man, a pastor, a saint, a friend, a brother. That is his day. A day we will remember him a year after. We are going to pull every string and we are hoping you will also support us to make it a glorious day. It is not just a book launch; it is a celebration of an icon. Dimgba Igwe can never die as long as I live. He can never die, I have said it.</p>
<p><strong>THE MAN OF GOD WHO IS FILLING DIMGBA’S VACUUM</strong></p>
<p><strong>In your column of recent, we have noticed this Pastor Abraham Sam Aiyedogbon coming to console you at all time, who is he and why is he getting so close to you?</strong></p>
<p>He read my column after the death of Dimgba where I was asking, ‘Pray for me’. And he saw the column as very spiritual, that it was not me that wrote it; that it was God that inspired me to write it. So, he came here and prayed for me and he equally gave me a prophetic message and he said since there is a vacuum in my life that he wants to fill that vacuum. Everything that my friend did, he wants to be my next friend. He was very, very touched. That God is saying he should be there for me. And who am I to say I don’t want a friendship from such a very renowned man of God?  It is not like a “re-marriage” because nobody can fill the shoe of my friend Dimgba Igwe but Aiyedogbon has been there for me.  He has supported me and I thank God for meeting such a great man of God. I count myself blessed, I count myself lucky and everyday we exchange test messages, praying for each other, inspiring each other. He is a very, very busy man and for such a man to have my time, I don’t take it for granted o. I mean, he pastors a great church Chapel of Glory  in Lagos and for such a man to really, really humble himself to say ‘Look, this iniquity man, called Mike Awoyinfa, I want to be your friend’, ah, it is God o. It is God.</p>
<p><strong>WHY I STOPPED PUBLISHING ENTERTAINMENT EXPRESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your newspaper project, Entertainment Express stopped immediately after Uncle Dimgba Igwe’s death and a lot of people felt you had to close down the newspaper because you couldn’t just face the reality of not having your friend around again? </strong></p>
<p>That one is a long story. You see newspaper business, when you want to go into it you need something, something financially big. Big, big, big money. And the kind of money that is required for us to sustain that kind of project, we don’t have it, don’t let us fool ourselves. It is a project that requires nothing less than five hundred million or one billion naira because it is not just about pushing the product into the market that matters. You need a mix of other supports like branding, jingles, television and making a whole lot of noise. You need an advert support; I mean for a paper of that small budget, we tried in the market. We got adverts but it wasn’t enough to carry it and we started on a very, very pocket friendly level. We were selling for N50 per copy and for me, N50 naira is not a business, it is too ridiculous. There was a time we went for N100 per copy, and because people were used to N50, they were saying ‘how can I suddenly be paying N100? So, it affected us in a way and that in itself was a reason to look into the whole idea and make a change.</p>
<p><strong>So, how profitable was the business?</strong></p>
<p>To me, entertainment is not a business that I will encourage anybody to go into.
