<p>The General Overseer of MFM, Dr Daniel Olukoya, made the announcement in Lagos at the monthly live broadcast programme of the church, tagged, ‘Power Must Change Hand’, which was monitored in Abuja.</p>
<p>He said 180 First Class graduates in the 2014 academic year and two others, who received NYSC Presidential honours after completing the National Youth Service Corps scheme, would get N500, 000 each.</p>
<p>Olukoya said the First Class honours award, which started with 12 students, had risen to 180, explaining that it was meant to encourage hard work among students.</p>
<p>He said the award was put in place to reward members of MFM, who were dedicated to their academic work, while also creating time to serve God.</p>
<p>A pastor, Shade Olukoya, and Vice Chancellor, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, Prof. Bamitale Omole, presented the award to the recipients.</p><div class="wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle" style="margin: 5px; padding: 0px;"><div style="text-align: center; background:#F6F2F2; padding-top:7px;">

<p>Omole lauded the recipients for their dedication to their academic work and also serving God.</p>
<p>He commended the students for making themselves, families and the church of God proud through their hard work.</p>
<p>Omole urged the recipients to appreciate the grace of God upon their lives, noting that many of their peers, who started with them, could not complete their courses for different reasons.</p>
<p>He called on other churches to emulate MFM by encouraging hardworking students through similar awards.</p>

<p>A statement from the European Food Safety Authority disclosed that the foodstuffs were banned because they contain ‘a high level of unauthorized pesticide.’</p>
<p>Nigerian beans were said to have been banned because they contain between 0.03mg per kg to 4.6mg/kg of dichlorvos pesticide when the acceptable maximum residue limit is 0.01mg/kg.</p>
<p>The food import ban is slated to be lifted in 2016.</p>

<p>The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Mr.MacJohn ‎Nwaobiala‎, revealed this on Tuesday after briefing President Muhammadu Buhari of his ministry&#8217;s activities and challenges at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.</p>
<p>The policy had led to protests in certain parts of the country as certain candidates who applied to the University of Lagos were unable to register for the school&#8217;s Post UTME after the school allegedly made use of 250 as a screening benchmark.  The institution&#8217;s authorities announced that only candidates whose names were officially forwarded by JAMB would be  eligible to participate in this year’s UNILAG Post-UTME.</p>
